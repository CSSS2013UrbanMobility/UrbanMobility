Formal description of the model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
We propose a simplified model of daily urban mobility that takes into account
 individual choices between different types of transport.
 Feedback from the positions of agents at micro-level gives integrated macro-flo
ws in the street network whose influenced themselves local speed and sometimes
 route choices of agents.
 Flows have also a component representing externalities such as traffic
 from outside the city that we can't represent as agents.
 More than having an accurate model that we could well calibrate on real
 data, the aim is to explore the aspect of influence of decision-making
 rules, and that way of the type of population, on the global patterns.
 An other application is to proceed to multi-criteria optimisation on a
 modification of the public transport infrastructure.
 We present here the formal description of our model.

\begin_layout Section
Global framework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We work either on imaginary city or with projected geographic description
 of a real city, so the space on which individuals move is a subset 
\begin_inset Formula $C\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 We suppose that the road network and public transportation network are
 represented by two Euclidian graphs, with 
\family roman
\series medium
\shape up
\size normal
\emph off
\bar no
\strikeout off
\uuline off
\uwave off
\noun off
\color none

\begin_inset Formula $V=(x_{i},y_{i})_{1\leq i\leq n(G)}$

, 
\begin_inset Formula $G=(V,E)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $E\subset V\times V$
\end_inset

, and with respectively the same notations for 
\begin_inset Formula $G'$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, we assume the existence of an resistance function on the edges
 of the road network, which will be anisotropic in order to simplify the
 implementation, and that will depend on the current charge of the edge.
 For the public transport, speeds in edges only depend of time, and will
 be determined by real frequencies.
 For use of street network by foot, we assume that no congestion is possible
 so resistance is constant regarding time and charge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time is discretised given a variable step 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, for which the value is not supposed to influence the results under a certain
 precision treshold, which determination will be one of the first aims of
 the experiments.

Agents description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agents can be of three different types, what has a direct consequence in
 their time-table and decision-making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The set of agents is described as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}\simeq$

\begin_layout Standard
Given the time-table of an agent 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

, represented as a function 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{a}:D_{a}\rightarrow C$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{a}\in\mathcal{P}([0;24])$
\end_inset

 (most probably defined on finite subset), we propose the existence of a
 stochastic process of decision
